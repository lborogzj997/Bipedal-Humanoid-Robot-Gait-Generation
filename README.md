# Bipedal Robot Gait Generation and Inverse Kinematics Simulation Script

This project contains two scripts:

    traj_gen.py: Generates gait motion trajectories for the bipedal feet and hip, and outputs them as CSV files.

    ik_traj.py: Reads foot-end and hip information from the trajectory files, solves for the robot's joint angles using inverse kinematics, and performs animation simulations.

Suitable for tasks such as bipedal robot gait planning, simulation verification, and control command generation.

## Script Description
### 1. traj_gen.py — Gait Trajectory Generation

Used to generate spatial trajectories for bipedal feet, simulating leg lifting motions and hip movements, and exporting them as CSV files.
Features:

-Generates X/Y/Z positions and pitch orientation angles for left and right feet

-Synchronously generates Y/Z/Roll swaying motions for the hip

-Outputs trajectories to the foot_trajectory.csv file

-Built-in animation visualization: foot-end trajectories in the X-Z plane

### Adjustable Parameters:
Parameter Name	Description	Units

    dt	            //Command sending period	seconds
    A_x	            //Forward movement distance per step	meters
    A_z	            //Foot lifting height per step	meters
    A_Y	            //Inward movement distance per step (cat-walk style)	meters
    n_loops	        //Number of gait cycles (one cycle includes one right step and one left step)	unitless
    max_pitch_deg	//Maximum ankle pitch angle when lifting the foot	degrees
    A_y_base	    //Amplitude of left-right hip sway	meters
    A_z_base	    //Amplitude of up-down hip movement	meters
    A_roll_base_deg	//Left-right sway angle (roll) of the hip	degrees
    swing_ratio	    //Ratio of leg swing time to the total cycle time (double support for the rest)	float (0~1)
    x0_right/left	//Initial X coordinate for right/left foot	meters
    y0_right/left	//Initial Y coordinate for right/left foot	meters
    z0_right/left	//Initial Z coordinate for right/left foot	meters
    
Output File:

    foot_trajectory.csv
    
Each row contains: right foot pose, left foot pose, base link pose (including roll)

### 2. ik_traj.py — Inverse Kinematics Simulation Execution

Used to read the trajectory generated by traj_gen.py, solve for all robot joint angles via inverse kinematics, and drive the PyBullet model to play the gait animation in real-time.
Features:

    Loads the URDF model (default path is sz13/urdf/sz13.urdf, customizable)

    Uses pybullet.calculateInverseKinematics to solve the foot-end trajectory

    Outputs data files of joint angles over time

Adjustable Parameters:
Parameter Name	Description	Default Value
use_gui	Whether to enable the graphical interface (turn off to speed up calculation)	True
urdf_path	URDF file path (must be an absolute or relative path)	"sz13/urdf/sz13.urdf"
Output File:

    joint_positions_output.csv: Joint angles per frame (raw inverse kinematics results), unit: radians

Usage Instructions

Run                                       
                                   
        traj_gen.py
Adjust parameters; after running, the trajectory animation (X-Z plane) will be automatically generated and displayed
Closing the graphics window indicates generation is complete.
The trajectory file will be saved as foot_trajectory.csv

Run 

       ik_traj.py
Reads the trajectory from foot_trajectory.csv and executes inverse kinematics


    Set use_gui = True 
to view the robot motion animation
Set it to False to speed up calculation if visualization is not needed

Example configuration (in ik_traj.py):

```python
use_gui = False
urdf_path = "your_robot.urdf"
